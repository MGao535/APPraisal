# Purpose

This app is meant for CMMI consultants to be able to keep track of their appraisals. Each client can only have 4 appraisals every 3 months and the app is meant to automate how many appraisals a consultant can put for each client a year. 

## Features

This app has a 3 month calendar meant for one appraisal. Appraisal dates will be marked on the calendar and each type of appraisal will be in a different color. There also is a add page that allows the consultant to add an appraisal. There also is a year calendar that shows the entire year. An edit page is planned to be made where the consultant can edit appraisals by selecting a client from a list.
